# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE GOLF INDUSTRY: HOW CALLAWAY GOLF IS LEVERAGING AI IN CLUB FACE DESIGN

## Overview and Origin

### Name of company: 

TopGolf Callaway Brands. The TopGolf Callaway brand encompasses many brands such as: 

- Callaway Golf (Equipment design and manufacturing)
- TopGolf (Interactive driving ranges)
- Travis Mathew (Golf clothing)
- TopTracer (Lauch monitors) 
- Odyssey (Putters) 
- Ogio (Golf bags)
- Jack Wolfskin (Outdoor clothing) 
- World Golf Tour (Virtual/video game) 

Generally speaking, Callaway Golf is the company’s most recognizable brand and a global marketplace leader in the golf equipment industry. This case study will focus on **Callaway Golf** and how they’re leveraging AI in club face design. 

### When was the company incorporated? Who are the founders?

The Callaway Golf Company was founded by Ely Callaway and incorporated in California in 1982.

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Avid golfer Ely Callaway, already a successful businessman in the textile and wine industries, took advantage of an opportunity to invest in a struggling golf club-making company (Hickory Sticks USA), mostly because they were his favorite brand of club to use. He bought half the company in 1982, renaming it "Callaway Hickory Sticks USA." By 1984, he owned the whole company and relocated it to its present-day home of Carlsbad, CA. Since then, Callaway Golf has risen to become one of the world’s leading makers of golf equipment and apparel. 

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 

Publicly traded company. NYSE | MODG (Common Stock). The current valuation of Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp is US$ 1.96 Bn.

## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

As both an AI enthusiast and student, and a passionate golfer, I often find myself pondering how these two seemingly different worlds can converge to help average golfers like me improve their scores and produce a more enjoyable golfing experience. That is, how can we marry the power and insights gained from artificial intelligence to the world of golf? 

There are several ways in which AI is making inroads into golf already. Unsurprisingly, there are a several apps already on the market that claim to use AI to help the average golfer improve. These are usually installed on a smartphone, and work in conjunction with the device's camera (and perhaps a launch monitor) to measure swing metrics, collect datapoints, compare them to various swing models, and then recommend corrective actions and drills to resolve the weakest parts of a golfer's swing. These apps certainly merit a deeper dive into how they are using AI to inform the golfer. 

However, the biggest companies in the golf industry have embraced AI with promises of groundbreaking improvements in not only club design, but ball technology, and the overall player experience. Callaway Golf has been at the forefront of this movement, and further cemented it's leadership in this space with the release of the 2024 Callaway Paradym AI Smoke drivers. For this case study, we'll be focusing on AI as it relates to Callaway's golf club face design, as this is the segment of the golf industry that can readily, measurably, and materially benefit from leveraging AI into its club design and manufacturing processes. 

**Note:** Another important element in the performance of a golf club is the club's shaft, where matching the right shaft with the right club head is key to the club fitting process, and maximizing a player's shot performance. Shafts differ in stiffness and flex points, and no doubt shaft manufacturers are dabbling in AI as well. But, for this case study, we'll remain focused on club face design.

While other major equipment manufacturers are actively implementing AI into their design and manufacturing processes, we can say with confidence that Calloway has largely led the way in implementing AI into its equipment production. In fact, Callaway first claimed club development using AI as far back as 2019 with the release of its Epic Flash Drivers and Fairway Woods. 

However, as I learn more about AI, I approach these bold AI claims with a degree of skepticism. Are we truly witnessing a meaningful integration of a revolutionary technology into the game of golf, or is AI simply being used as a marketing buzzword, dressing up what remains a traditional pursuit at its core (that is, building equipment that, in general, produces longer ball flight and smaller misses)? 

In this case study, we'll take a closer look at the role AI is playing at Callaway Golf and how it informs and influences their club face designs. We’ll also look at the challenges and opportunities that await Callaway as they stake their claim to being the leader in AI-designed and tested golf gear. 

### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Callaway’s customer base extends from beginners to professional PGA TOUR players. They make equipment for use by golfers of all ages and skill levels. According to market research company [Statistica]( https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/toys-hobby/sports-equipment/golf-equipment/worldwide), the Golf Equipment market worldwide is projected to generate a revenue of US$ 25.5bn in 2024. When considering the population, the per-person revenue worldwide is approximately US$ 3.29 in 2024. 

This market segment is expected to experience an annual growth rate of 5.63%, as measured by the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2024 to 2028. The United States continues to dominate this market with its strong demand for high-quality clubs and advanced technology. 

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Callaway claims that the new family of Paradym AI Smoke Drivers, Fairway Woods, Irons, and Hybrid are both designed with extensive player data and a new “AI Smart Face” to create “sweet spots” across the entire face of the club. To those uninitiated to the intricacies of golf and what makes for a “good” golf shot, hitting the ball with the sweet spot (exact center) of the club is paramount to success. This sweet spot is notoriously small, and what Callaway seems to be claiming is that, thanks to AI, the entire face of the club is basically a sweet spot. Or, to be more specific, there are multiple sweet spots all over the club face.  

The Paradym Ai Smoke Drivers represent a huge leap forward in Callaway's AI journey, with the most sophisticated face they've ever created based on player data and machine learning. The AI Smart Face optimizes driver performance using swing dynamics from thousands of golfers. By leveraging AI and Machine Learning, these swing dynamics are used to create over 50,000 virtual face prototypes, optimizing performance for each head shape. Callaway uses the following concepts in generating their AI-informed club faces:

- Swing Code: Callaway states that the AI Smoke has the “World's First AI Smart Face™ designed using real player data.” That "real player data" is called “Swing Code” and is a set of 1,040,000 data points from 250,000 swings collected from Callaway Fitting Centers. Swing Code data consist of:
    - impact location
    - swing speed
    - angle of attack
    - club path and face orientation at time of impact. 
    
    With this information, we get four points of data for 250,000 swings and you get 1,000,000 data points.

- AI Face Optimization: AI allows Callaway to test tens of thousand virtual prototypes instead of being limited to the less-than-10 physical prototypes.
- Micro deflections: With AI Smart Face technology, micro deflections are activated upon impact helping to optimize launch and spin on off-center shots. The result is (as mentioned) a sweet spot not just in the center, but essentially all over the face.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing; you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

As mentioned, Callaway's AI Smart Face technology, which leverages real golfer swing data combined with AI, creates club face prototypes that generate speed and consistency with tight dispersion into target areas (the middle of the fairway, green, etc.), while promoting optimized ball flight and forgiveness. 

So the question remains: How exactly is Callaway using AI to inform the build process of its equipment? What technologies are they using, and how does the process work?  

As with any AI application, it needs to be trained with swing metrics from golfers in order to develop the (hopefully) accurate data models that are actionable for the build process. Here Callaway has a big advantage over rivals, in that it has over a quarter million swings-worth of data collected from a variety of sources (which includes its own fitting centers and TopGolf driving ranges). 

### What exactly is "swing data"?  

When a golfer goes to a club fitter to be fit for a new set of clubs or perhaps simply a new driver, a launch monitor (basically, radar) will measure some, any, or all of the following swing data metrics in less than a second: 

- Ball speed: The speed of the ball after impact, measured in miles per hour.  
- Launch angle: The initial direction of the ball, relative to the ground and target line, measured in degrees.  
- Spin: The amount of backspin on the ball.  
- Spin axis: The angle at which the ball spins, causing it to curve in that direction.  
- Clubhead speed: The speed of the club at impact.  
- Smash factor: The ratio of club speed to ball speed.  
- Impact location: The location on the club face where the ball was struck.  
- Club face angle: The angle of the club face at impact.  
- Club path: The direction of the club's swing before and after impact.  
- Distance (carry and roll out). 
- And much more... 

It's important to note here that Callaway is very guarded when it comes to sharing their home-built AI design process, and it's not hard to understand why given the competition in this sector. However, we can say that, essentially, what Callaway is doing is "generative design," a method of using AI algorithms to generate and evaluate multiple design alternatives based on input from the user. They use data points to set parameters for their AI model to design to and then leverage neural networks that process vast amounts of data to improve the thickness patterns of the driver’s face. By simulating countless variables, such as club path, ball speed, and impact points, the AI identifies the most effective configurations for enhancing performance. This has been applied across all their clubs, from drivers to irons, like in the Paradym and Apex AI series.

Then, they test and validate what's produced and tweak as needed. This isn't particularly new for Callaway, as they've done this for years now. With more than 80,000 lines of custom code built into their design system, they have a model that allows them to come up with thousands of iterations of designs in a much shorter time period than would be possible with only humans working on it. Callaway have openly stated that the models have created designs they would never have come up with on their own, or even imagined as possible.

### How the process works

As mentioned, Callaway engineers wrote the software necessary to get the AI started on the clubface-design project, and the company purchased a $5 Million supercomputer which the manufacturer helped configure to work with the software being developed. Part of getting started was helping AI develop its own understanding of the physics involved between a clubface and ball at impact, and the in-depth details of the USGA’s (United States Golf Association) conformance test for clubface "CT," or Characteristic Time. This way, the AI wouldn't generate club faces that were illegal and violate the maximum performance specifications as laid out but the USGA.

To keep the face design focused, the supercomputer was instructed that its design had to work in accordance with the strict specifications of other design features of the clubhead, so that the face would work in harmony with all club head components, such as sole, crown, adjustable perimeter weighting, etc., to promote maximum performance. The supercomputer created one design after another, learning from each, working non-stop, day and night. According to Dr. Alan Hocknell, Callaway’s head of R&D at the time: 

    “Our normal process for developing something like this is to try several iterations, with the design team analyzing and discussing the validity of each one, but we’re limited to a human’s assessment ability, and how many ideas a human can come up with. AI used Machine Learning to navigate that design and analysis loop thousands and thousands of times, while doing a better job than a human can of assessing each iteration.” 
    
The supercomputer worked continuously for three weeks before arriving at a design it couldn’t improve on in terms of ball speed generation. Altogether it created more than 15,000 iterations, or “virtual prototypes.” To understand the kind of computing power required to do this, it would take a conventional desktop computer 34 years to run this same analysis. 

At first sight, Callaway engineers were stunned. The design was asymmetrical, with what appeared to be a random pattern of waves and ripples of different sizes and depths spanning the surface of the back of the face. It bore no resemblance to any face Callaway had conceived before. By looking at it, it’s hard to make sense of how it works. To the professionals at Callaway, it looked like a huge mistake. The supercomputer also predicted what the face would deliver in terms of performance, including ball speed gains. 

Callaway immediately machined a physical prototype and tested it, finding the computer’s prediction was accurate within .1%. More importantly, the results blew their minds. They were remarkable.
    
    “We thought AI could figure out aspects of how the face works in the dynamic situation of impact to arrive at a deeper understanding of how the face works and how to improve its performance,” said Hocknell. “That’s what happened. We learned there are things going on in one part of the face that influence what’s happening in other parts of the face at impact and this is a whole higher order level of analysis and design,” said Hocknell. 
    
The unique design forced changes in the entire face production process. Callaway's CAD designers had to work differently and their manufacturing methods had to change as well. Forging this new AI-generated face design was significantly harder than previous face designs, and even measuring the unusual contours of this new face posed new challenges.

## Landscape

### What field is the company in and what have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?

Today, golf is all about distance, as in maximizing it (hopefully) with accuracy. Over the last decade, the golf club-making industry (and particularly drivers) has been mostly focused on delivering more distance to the average golfer through the use of advanced materials and strategically placed weights both inside and outside of the club head. This is a result of some of the professional game's newest and brightest stars employing a "bomb and gouge" style of play that's been effective for a handful of top professionals. 

"Bomb and gouge" basically means hitting the ball as far as possible off the tee, and not worrying too much if it's straight or not. In fact, the goal is to simply get the ball as close to the hole as possible, regardless of whether it's on the fairway or in the rough, long grass, or sand. Then, one simply "gouges" (or hacks) it out onto the green (easier said than done). This can require a lot of upper body strength, which is also a new trend in the game, and one that's certainly tied to the "bomb and gouge" mentality. Data science has shown that, no matter where the ball goes, the closer to the pin you are, the greater your chances of putting the ball in the cup and generating lower scores. All golfers still want to be accurate, but right now, the focus is on distance, because the numbers say that that's the key to lower scoring.

Golf today is all about data too, and that's an area where the game has exploded thanks to the influx of launch monitors. Like all other industries, the golf business was swept up in the *Big Data* revolution, whereby club fittings went from a coach or fitter asking, “How did that one feel,” or, “you seem to be hitting it left... Let’s try something else,” to the use of launch monitors that can precisely measure any or all of the following swing and ball data:  

- Apex Height 
- Attack Angle 
- Backspin 
- Ball Speed 
- Carry Deviation Angle 
- Carry Deviation Distance 
- Carry Distance 
- Club Face (open/closed)
- Club Path 
- Club Speed 
- Face to Path 
- Launch Angle 
- Launch Direction 
- Sidespin 
- Smash Factor 
- Spin Axis 
- Spin Rate 
- Total Deviation Angle 
- Total Deviation Distance 
- Total Distance 

Launch monitors (which range from $500 to $30,000) have been an enormous difference maker in club fittings and club production, and have produced an avalanche of data and metrics that can be leveraged by AI to inform thousands of possible club face designs and the materials used to make the face of both drivers and irons. 

### What are the other major companies in this field?

- Acushnet (better known as Titleist). 
- Ping 
- Cobra Golf 
- Cleveland Golf 
- TaylorMade 
- Mizuno 
- PXG 
- Srixon 
- Wilson 

While Callaway chose to develop their own proprietary AI-based design system, new companies like [Altair](https://altair.com/blog/articles/transforming-golf-club-design-with-artificial-intelligence) provide the infrastructure and tools needed for other golf club manufacturers to easily implement AI into their development processes. Ping, Wilson, and Cleveland are Calloway competitors currently leveraging this platform and making headway in AI-based golf equipment production.

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Callaway Golf has used AI to develop its latest clubs, claiming that the use of Machine Learning algorithms and a supercomputer helped reduce a tradition of 34 years of product design into a matter of just days. Using AI and Machine Learning, Callaway's supercomputer worked non-stop, creating 15,000 virtual prototypes, learning from each one, until it arrived at what it deemed the best design in terms of what Callaway asked for, which was to deliver the fastest possible ball speed while at the same time conforming to the rules on face design maintained by the United States Golf Association (USGA), one of golf’s governing bodies.

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

As with almost all companies, it’s all about the bottom line. So, how have Callaway’s AI-branded clubs been performing in the marketplace? 

Callaway’s AI-branded golf clubs, particularly the 2024 models like the Apex Ai200, Ai300, and Paradym Ai Smoke series, have been well-received in the market, showcasing strong performance due to their integration of artificial intelligence technology.  

However, despite strong reception in terms of innovation and product appeal, Callaway's golf equipment sales declined by 8.2% in Q2 2024, partly due to comparisons with the previous year's product launches and fluctuating foreign exchange rates. This decline impacted profits, as the segment's operating income dropped by nearly 20%. Nonetheless, the company remains financially stable, focusing on product innovation.

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

In a nutshell, competition is fierce. Callaway Golf's performance against competitors in 2024 has been mixed. While Callaway's Topgolf division showed strong growth, increasing revenue by 5% and improving profitability, its golf equipment segment faced challenges. Revenues in this segment dropped by 8.2% due to stiff competition and the impact of previous product launches like Big Bertha. Compared to competitors such as TaylorMade and Titleist, which have also innovated heavily, Callaway's position remains strong but not without hurdles in maintaining market share in equipment. They have been bold (and first) to start marketing their products as AI-informed, but competitors are quickly catching up.  

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

First, a general observation: Aside from the raw number of data points, one thing that raises an eyebrow about their dataset is that 250,000 doesn’t seem like a particularly large number of swings. I haven’t been to Callaway for a fitting so it’s possible that their fitting process is uniquely lean. Based on how many times I swung a club during my fitting experiences at Club Champion (a well-known club fitter), I’d expect a much larger number of swings at Callaway’s disposal. Perhaps they need to expand their datasets to their TopGolf venues (which they might already do). In all likelihood, they should be expanding their swing code to at least 500,000 swings, if not millions. 

Also, it's a little surprising that only four datapoints per swing are available within their process. However, another way to interpret the data is that there are 1,040,000 data points per swing, captured as part of those four principal components. The biomechanics of a swing are complex and, given the wealth of data that’s provided by at-home launch monitors, I wouldn’t be surprised if a single swing contains that much data. 

Secondly, Callaway makes no claim to making golf balls designed with AI and machine learning. As such, my recommendation is to quickly leverage existing datasets toward golf ball development. Titleist is the market leader in golf balls, and a Callaway AI-developed ball could go a long way to reducing the gap. 

Several companies are using AI to develop innovative golf balls that provide advanced data and performance insights. One of the most notable is OnCore Innovations with their GENiUS Ball. This ball integrates AI through embedded MEMS sensors, Bluetooth connectivity, and cloud-based reporting, allowing players to track detailed metrics like ball speed, spin, and launch data in real time. The GENiUS Ball aims to help golfers of all skill levels improve their game through this comprehensive feedback.  

Another company venturing into AI-enhanced golf products is Bridgestone, known for their development of cutting-edge visual and performance technologies in their TOUR B series. While Bridgestone is currently more focused on visual technologies like their "MINDSET" system, which helps golfers improve mental focus, it points to their broader push into tech-enhanced equipment. 

These innovations highlight the growing role of AI in personalizing the golf experience by providing actionable data to improve player performance.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I believe it would help the company find consistency in both their engineering processes, and marketing messaging. Customers might be confused if some elements of Callaway Golf are heavily leveraging AI to develop clubs, but nothing else. By developing golf balls using essentially the same data models they use for swings, they can “align” their AI-based offerings and stay at the forefront of AI’s induction into the world of golf.  

Most importantly, AI is the next frontier in the game, and being left behind is not an option. Callaway seems to have recognized this trend early on by procuring their first $5 Million supercomputer to develop the original Flash Face, a project led by Dr Alan Hocknell in 2019. Interestingly, Hocknell left Callaway in 2022 after spending 24 years with the company and joined Acushnet, parent company of Footjoy and Titleist (Callaway's major competitor), as their VP of Advanced Research and Innovation in 2023. I am curious to see what Titleist comes up with in the near future, and whether a supercomputer is on their procurement roadmap too. In fact, I expect AI-branded and developed products from Titleist very soon. All manufacturers will follow suit. We might arrive at a point where golfers (at most levels) might reject equipment that doesn’t (truly) incorporate AI.  

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Manufacturing an AI-powered golf ball requires a blend of advanced AI technologies and precision engineering techniques. Here are the key AI technologies involved in the manufacturing process: 

- AI-Driven Material Optimization: AI algorithms can assist in optimizing the material composition of the golf ball. Machine learning models analyze large datasets from previous prototypes and simulations to predict the best materials for durability, performance, and sensor integration. This ensures the ball maintains its integrity while embedding electronic components like sensors. 

- Advanced Robotics and Automation: The precision required to embed sensors and electronic components inside a golf ball necessitates the use of AI-powered robotics. Robots equipped with AI-driven vision systems can handle delicate tasks, such as integrating MEMS sensors, wiring, and other electronics, ensuring accuracy and consistency during mass production. 

- Computer Vision for Quality Control: AI-powered computer vision systems are employed to inspect each golf ball during manufacturing. These systems can detect even microscopic defects or inconsistencies in the material, structure, or embedded electronics, ensuring that every ball meets the required performance standards. 

- Simulation and Testing Using AI: Before finalizing a design, AI is used to simulate real-world conditions, like ball flight, spin, and impact forces. By training machine learning models on these simulations, manufacturers can predict how different designs and materials will affect the ball's performance, allowing for rapid prototyping and refinement. 

- AI-Enhanced Sensor Calibration: Once the MEMS sensors are embedded into the ball, AI technologies are used to calibrate them. Machine learning algorithms help to fine-tune sensor readings, ensuring accurate data capture during play. AI can adjust for variations in sensor placement or material properties that may affect performance  

- Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment: AI is also used in the maintenance of manufacturing machinery. Machine learning models monitor the condition of manufacturing equipment in real-time, predicting when maintenance is required to prevent downtime, which is crucial for high-precision production lines like those needed for AI-powered golf balls. 

By integrating these AI technologies, manufacturers can produce AI-powered golf balls with consistent quality and performance, while leveraging data-driven insights to improve both the production process and the product itself.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The use of these technologies could very well produce a golf ball that (while maintaining compliance with USGA thresholds), produces unparalled distance, control, and spin conditions that likely improve player performance at all levels, but especially at the very highest levels of the game. Here is where the margins are so fine that a ball that gives a pro even the slightest edge under tournament conditions can be the difference between winning millions, or languishing at the bottom of leaderboards.
